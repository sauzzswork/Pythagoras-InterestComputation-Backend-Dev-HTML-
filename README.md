# Trigonometry-InterestComputation-Backend-Dev-HTML-
This project is a solution for a backend developer assignment focused on populating pre-designed HTML templates with dynamically calculated data. The core task was to solve two mathematical problems and manually insert the solutions into their respective HTML templates without altering the original structure or CSS.

## ‚ú® Features

This repository contains two solved problems:

* **Trigonometry Solution (`temp1.html`):**
    * Calculates the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle using the Pythagorean theorem for sides 8 and 15.
    * Solves for the value of `Sin A + Cos A`.
    * Updates the visual triangle diagram and formula explanations with the correct values.

* **Compound Interest Solution (`interestcompounded.html`):**
    * A two-part problem that first calculates the interest rate (R) where a principal of ‚Çπ5,000 grows to ‚Çπ6,050 in 2 years.
    * It then uses the calculated rate (10%) to find the final amount for the same principal after 3 years.
    * The solution populates all calculation steps, including fractions, powers, and the final highlighted results.

## üöÄ How To Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the folder:**
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3.  **View the solutions:**
    * Open the `temp1.html` and `interestcompounded.html` files in any web browser to see the final output.
    * Make sure the image files (`arrow.png`, `interesticon.png`) are in the same directory for them to display correctly.
